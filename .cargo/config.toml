# === OPTIONAL: Fast Linker Configuration ===
# Uncomment ONE of the following sections based on your system.
# These can provide 30-50% faster linking but require additional tools.
#
# --- Option 1: lld (recommended, requires: sudo apt install lld clang) ---
# [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# linker = "clang"
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"]
#
# [target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# linker = "clang"
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld"]
#
# --- Option 2: mold (fastest, requires: sudo apt install mold) ---
# [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# linker = "clang"
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=mold"]
#
# --- Option 3: gold (available on most systems) ---
# [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
# rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=gold"]
